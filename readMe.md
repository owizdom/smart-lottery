## Lottery Smart Contract
#### About
This is a simple lottery smart contract which allows for the creation and management of Lotteries developed with the help of ChainLInk VRF which helps to generate random numbers for selecting winners in a randomized manner.

The contract also includes features like:

- Ticket Purchasing.

- Operator Commission

- Prize Claiming

  #### Developed using REMIX - So far, I have been loving using Remix
     #### ( i have not been using the awesome Foundry due to poor system resources) 

#### Notes

Plan to deploy to a testnet sooon enough when I am done adding few more features and doing basic optimizations( will learn it soon enough so...till then)
